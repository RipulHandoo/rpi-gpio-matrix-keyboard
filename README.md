# Raspberry Pi GPIO Matrix Keyboard
User space GPIO matrix keyboard driver for Raspbery Pi. Can be used to put Raspberry Pi into an old computer case with a functional keyboard
without any extra hardware like Arduino or Keyrah.

The code is designed for Commodore Plus/4 keyboard layout, but can be easily modifed to support other 80s and 90s computers' keyboards (Commodore 64, 8-bit Atari, Amiga, etc.)

## Compilation
```
cmake .
make
```
## Installation
To install the keyboard driver as a systemd serice
```
sudo cmake install
```
## Commodore Plus/4 Wiring
This is the wiring used to define the `cols`, `rows`, and `keymap`. Additionally the LED pins can be connected to a free GPIO and GND for extra functionality (or simply +5v).

## Python Prototype
The Python script `gpio_keyboard.py` is my initial version of this driver. It has basically the same funcitonality except:
* Python `evdev` does not seem to support `EV_REP` on the uinput objects, so the emulated keyboard will not generate auto-repeat
* At 60Hz scanning frequency it takes about 6% CPU compared to <1% for the C version.
